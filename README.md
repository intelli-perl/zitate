# android-fortune

This repo is based on https://github.com/316k/android-fortune
A friend was asking to have something similar to this.

History:
V0.1 - Initial Version, based on the 316k repo but updated to
have it at least compiled on my system.

A Unix fortune viewer (app & widget) for Android.

By default, you will see the traditional Unix Fortunes, but you can add your own fortune files. Everything in `sdcard/fortunes/` will be added to the default fortunes.
